# Intellij Pets

Adds a cute pet to your favourite IDE.

Inspired (very heavily) by [vscode-pets](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets) created by [Tony Baloney](https://github.com/tonybaloney).

## How to use

- After installation, you'll find a pet icon on the right toolbar of your IDE, click on it to open the tool window
- To change the pet variant, go to Preferences > Tools > Pets, and select a pet variant (see screenshot below)

## Credits

- Original idea from [vscode-pets](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets) created by [Tony Baloney](https://github.com/tonybaloney)
